# David HackaTUM 2022 Finalist
The David app aims to improve the people's experience in the City of Munich with the help of gamification tools. The user can write stories about a building while roaming around the city and the stories are categorised into a particular genre with the help of Machine Learning.

The fun part is that the users can read stories written by other people about a particular theme and can upvote or downvote them, then the gamification part comes into play, there is a leader board of stories based on the number of downvotes and upvotes it has got and attractive badges also appear on the profile of the user based on the number of stories written by the user.

# IDEA
This is the github repository of an application for the event HackaTUM 2022, the annual Hackathon of TUM. This application basically improves the user experience in the city of Munich with the help of gamification tools. The user can write stories about a building while roaming around the city and the stories are categorised into a particular genre with the help of Machine Learning, the fun part is that the users can read stories written by other people about a particular and can upvote or downvote them, then the gamification part comes into play, there is a leaderboard of stories based on the number of downvotes and upvotes it has got and attractive badges also appear on the profile of the user based on the number of stories written by the user.

# OBJECTIVE
1. The app creates an environment where people can share and understand each other's ideas
2. The app is entertaining and informative at the same time.
3. The app can help passionate story writers to improve their skills based on the live assessment done by the readers.
4. By using this app, the users can improve their imagination and creativeness.

# TECHSTACK
1. Swift - For the app and the UI
2. Java - For the backend server
3. NLP - For the story categorisation
4. Python - To implement Natural Language Pre Processing

# Future Improvements
implement the circle of radian around currently location, so that nearby notes will also be accessible
Recommendation system of notes that might be interested to users with the help of machine learning
Use AR on mobile phones to scan buildings, read sticker notes attached to the buildings, we could even integrate video and music into this AR game so that the user might feel like living through someone's story.
